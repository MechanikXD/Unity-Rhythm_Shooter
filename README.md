# Rhythm Shooter
My personal project that as well dedicated as Diploma work for VARTO School courses "Unity Game Developer".
It's a Rogue-Like Rhythm-Shooter. Main mechanics are inspired by games such as "Hi-Fi Rush", "Metal: Hellsinger" and "BPM: Bullets Per Minute".
Rogue-Like part is designed by best representatives of such genre such as "Dead Cells" and "Hades".

Key Features:
  1) Reach project architecture
  2) Advanced Conductor class to manipulate music and rhythm
  3) Highly customisable upgrade system allowing for unique effects
  4) Procedural level generation
  5) Set of few weapons to choose from with different playstyles
  6) Variety of enemies done by using state machine behaviour and Unity NavMesh system (In progress)
